# Webpack Demo

> This is a demo on how to set up a project with webpack. Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It's intelligent enough to build all app dependencies based just on your file imports. It starts from a list of modules defined as entry points and recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module the application needs.

## Built With

- [x] Languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- [x] Module Bundler: Webpack
- [x] Code Editor: VS Code

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [x] A web browser like Google Chrome.
- [x] A code editor like Visual Studio Code with Git and Node.js.

You can check if Git is installed by running the following command in the terminal.
```
$ git --version
```

Likewise for Node.js and npm for package installation.
```
$ node --version && npm --version
```

### Setup

Clone the repository using the GitHub link provided below.

### Install

In the terminal, go to your file directory and run this command.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mavericks-db/webpack-demo.git
```

### Usage

```

```

To start webpack-dev-server, use this:
